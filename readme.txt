A WordPress plugin (required Woocoomerce to be installed) for creating pizza components. 
  
== Description ==
  
Pizza builder for [Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) - is a gawky attempt to be a Woocommerce plugin. It allows create components like ingredients, which normally not required to be a woocommerce product. These components can be included in product price or you can add every component price to product price and build product price based on components.

Pizza builder for Woocommerce should be user-friendly. Also there is a page for developers, where displayed not so difficult hooks mostly for displaying text. I prefer this way to be done, in order to have translation option.

= What it can =
* **Create components for woocommerce product** - supports only simple and variable products. Commonly created for pizza, but could be any food/meal product, or any other product.
* **Has 3 different views** - depends on what you choose to display. There are 2 views for additional components(extra components, for example, we have product "Fried moose with marjoram" and we want add to this meal ginger, roasted almonds, 
chopped garlic, seasoned with fresh ham and cabrales with blue mold) with tabs or without, and one view for Consist of block(which is by default for pizza)
* **Nice looking admin** - thanks to [Material Ui](https://mui.com/)
